The **razorbill** (*Alca torda*) is a seabird native to the North Atlantic. It is known for its distinctive appearance and strong, agile swimming ability. This species is often seen on rocky cliffs and cold coastal waters, where it thrives in its natural habitat.

### Key Characteristics

* **Appearance:**
    * Black and white plumage with a sleek, cylindrical body.
    * A sharp, heavy bill that is shaped like a razor, giving the bird its name.
    * A small patch of white on the undersides.
    * A striking black line running down from the bill to the chest.
* **Reproduction:**
    * Nests in large colonies on steep cliffs or rocky outcroppings.
    * Lays a single egg on a narrow, rocky ledge or crevice.
    * Both parents share incubation duties, and the chick is fed a diet of small fish.
* **Habitat:**
    * Prefers cold, nutrient-rich waters off the coasts of northern Europe, North America, and Greenland.
    * Often seen nesting on cliffs or rocky islands near the sea.
* **Diet:**
    * Carnivorous: Feeds mainly on small fish like herring, capelin, and sand eels.
    * Hunts by diving underwater, using its wings to propel itself in pursuit of prey.

### Unique Adaptations

* **Diving and Swimming:** Razorbills are excellent divers and use their wings like flippers to propel themselves underwater at great depths in search of food.
* **Strong Bill:** Their sharp, robust bill is ideal for catching and holding onto slippery fish.
* **Cliff-Nesting:** Razorbills nest on narrow ledges of steep cliffs, using their strong legs to climb and navigate these rocky surfaces.
* **Mating and Parental Care:** Razorbills form long-term pair bonds, and both parents take turns incubating the egg and feeding the chick.

### Conservation Status and Threats

* **Least Concern:** The razorbill is currently classified as "Least Concern" by the IUCN, but populations in some areas have shown signs of decline.
* **Threats:**
    * Climate change, which affects fish stocks and alters ocean conditions.
    * Overfishing, which reduces the availability of prey.
    * Habitat disturbance, particularly from human activities on nesting cliffs.
    * Oil spills, which can poison the birds or contaminate their food sources.

### Interesting Facts

* Razorbills are known for their remarkable diving abilities, reaching depths of up to 120 meters (400 feet).
* Their call is a distinctive, harsh, and grating sound, often heard in nesting colonies.
* Despite their awkward appearance on land, razorbills are graceful and efficient swimmers.
* Razorbills are often seen in pairs or small groups, especially during the breeding season.

### Conservation Efforts

* Protecting nesting colonies and reducing human disturbance in breeding areas.
* Monitoring fish stocks and advocating for sustainable fishing practices.
* Responding to oil spills and other environmental threats.
* Raising awareness of the importance of marine ecosystems and their impact on seabird populations.
